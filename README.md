Rewrite of the Krist Web Wallet, in React. This is a fully clientside Krist 
wallet that only needs to communicate to the Krist node itself. It securely 
saves wallets encrypted in your browser's Local Storage, so you don't have to 
type in wallet passwords ever again!

### Building (for development)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmpim/KristWeb2
cd KristWeb2

npm i -g pnpm # If you don't have pnpm, please use it for development

pnpm install
npm start # Run the development server
```

### Building (for production)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmpim/KristWeb2
cd KristWeb2
npm install
npm run build # Build the production files
npm start
```

### Contributing

As per tmpim convention, this project uses 
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as a
standard for commit messages.

### Contributing translations

Translation files are currently created manually in the 
[i18next JSON format](https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format). You can find
existing translations in [`public/locales`](public/locales). The 
[English (GB) translation](public/locales/en.json) is used as the fallback.

Language files are named with 
[IETF language tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag). Short
tags (e.g. `en` instead of `en-GB`) are preferred.

**IMPORTANT:** If you are adding a new language, you **must** add a listing for 
the language with the English name, native name, a country code (for the flag) 
and the contributors list to 
[`src/__data__/languages.json`](src/__data__/languages.json).

The library will automatically detect the language from your browser to use, but
for the sake of testing, you can override it by running the following command in
the developer console (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd>):

```js
localStorage.i18nextLng = "en";
```

If you need any help with specific i18next features (e.g. handling plurals),
don't hesitate to contact Lemmmy.

### Providing host attribution

To provide hosting credits in the sidebar footer, create the file
`host.json` in `src/__data__` with the following contents:

```json
{
  "name": "StealthyZakkki",
  "url": "https://github.com/Lemmmy"
}
```
